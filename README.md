Flask Tutorial
==============

This is my working repository for the [Flask tutorial](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/#tutorial). 

The basic functionality of the blog was just created by following along the tutorial snippets. 
My own work really starts with the implementation of the features listed in the [Keep Developing Section](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/next/) of the tutorial.
