Flaskr
======

This is my working repository for the [Flask tutorial](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/#tutorial). 

The basic functionality of the blog was created by following along the tutorial snippets. 

My own work really starts with the implementation of the features listed in the [Keep Developing Section](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/next/) of the tutorial. The added features are: detail post view, likes, comments, tags, title search, pagination, image upload, markdown formatting and RSS feed.
